# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
To perform an exploratory analysis for PyBer on the relationship between type of city, number of drivers and riders as well as percentage of total fares, riders and drivers by type of city. The analysis and visualizations will help PyBer improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for under-served neighbourhoods.

### Results

It is not surprising that the **Urban** setting has the highest number of rides, total drivers, total fares given that the setting has the highest population of the three "types".

It is also not surprising that the **Rural** setting has the lowest number of rides, total drivers and total fares given that the setting has the lowest population among the three "types".

The **Suburban** type, being the middle of the three types in terms of population, is in the middle with respect to the metrics covered.

In the **Rural** setting, there are 78 drivers for 125 rides. In the **Urban** setting, there are 2405 drivers for 1625 rides. The competition for those rides in the Urban setting is tougher seeing as drivers average less than one ride. When supply (in this case, drivers) exceeds demand (rides), price often goes down and the "Average Fare Per Ride" and "Average Fare Per Driver" reflects that dynamic in the Urban setting when compared to the Rural setting where the opposite happens, with demand (rides) exceeding supply (drivers).

### Summary
Given the relationship between supply (drivers) and demand (rides), and its effects on fare prices, it's recommended that the number of drivers in the Rural setting increase to lower the price. The number of drivers should come from the Urban setting. The Suburban setting should also absorb some of the drivers from the Urban setting to also initiate those changes in the fare metrics. Having more drivers in Rural and Suburban settings may also increase the number of rides thereby increasing the fare total in each category.
